# Status (living)

Last updated: 2026-07-23 (Gate 1 position coupling: final **48.05% train /
19.50% same-length / 1.50% length-4**. Result: **confirmed**, but the
tail-aligned/no-output-token risk materialized and broke the in-domain mechanism.
Proceed to selected Option 3 from the frozen physical-RoPE baseline).

## P2 grokking ladder (the active gate — see `claude code fable/FULL_TRANSCRIPT.md`)

| Rung | Setup (all T=1) | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | fixed single N, unseen x | **N=323: peak 8.6% but decays to ~2% by end of anneal; N=1073: peak 3.5%→1.5%** — real but non-monotone, never consolidates (`2026-07-23_t1only_fixedn_wd01/`) |
| 2 | multi-N seen at train, unseen x | **floor, 0.5-0.75%** (`2026-07-22_t1only_probe_*` — relabeled from "rung 3", see correction) |
| 3 | held-out N (`split_group=modulus`) | not run — strictly harder than rung 2, gate (≥5%) nowhere in sight |

Failure point is **below rung 2**: the one-step map is barely learnable even
per-modulus. No Hard-tier architecture work is informative until rung 1 clears a
real number. wd=1.0 refuted at d=32 (never fits train, `_wd1/`).

Digit micro-scan gate: a learned LSD→MSD scan with a discrete 16-state carry
reached 100% train but only 1.49% peak held-out-x at fixed N=1073. It also cost
about 8× in optimizer-step throughput versus the d=32 N=1073 rung-1 probe. Hosted e5
completed 613 steps and scored 0.50% on both test and held-out-T OOD.

## Hard leaderboard

We are **#11 at 0.03%** (`mof` / Claude Hard run). Top is **0.40%** (az). Nobody has solved the task.

## Next — positional reuse gate (you pick; agent implements)

Write PREDICT in [`experiments/predictions.md`](experiments/predictions.md) before any run.

1. Position coupling — failed in-domain, 1.5% length-4
2. **Selected next:** 1% target-length priming from the frozen baseline
3. Do not advance to carry propagation until positional reuse is resolved
